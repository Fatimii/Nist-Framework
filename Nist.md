# Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity:
"It is the policy of the United State to enhance the security ans resilience of the Nation's critical infrastructure and to maintain a cyber environment that encourages efficiency, innovation and economic prosperity while promoting safety, security, business, confidentiability, privacy and civil liberties."
# According To Executive Order:
- Align policy, business and technological approaches to address cyber risks
- Prioritized, flexible, repeatable, performance-based and cost-effective approach
- Identify areas for improvement to be addressed through future collaboration
- Be consistent with voluntary international standards
# CYBER-SECURITY FRAMEWORK:
A cybersecurity framework provides a common language and set of standards for security leaders across countries and industries to understand their security postures and those of their vendors. With a framework in place it becomes much easier to define the processes and procedures that your organization must take to assess, monitor, and mitigate cybersecurity risk.
# SEVEN COMMON CYBER-SECURITY FRAMEWORK:
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- ISO 27001 and ISO 27002
- SOC2
- NERC-CIP
- HIPAA
- GDPR
- FISMA
# Why Cybersecurity Framework:
- It results in a shift from compliance to action and specific outcomes
- It gives you a measure of where you are and where you need to go
- It can be implemented in stages or degrees which makes it more appealing to business
- It has built-in maturity model and gap analysis so you don't need additional maturity on top of CSF
# TYPES OF FRAMEWORK:
## The NIST Cyber Security Framework:
The NIST Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, or the “NIST cybersecurity framework” for brevity’s sake, was established during the Obama Administration in response to presidential Executive Order 13636. The NIST was designed to protect America’s critical infrastructure (e.g., dams, power plants) from cyberattacks.
NIST is a set of voluntary security standards that private sector companies can use to find, identify, and respond to cyberattacks. The framework also features guidelines to help organizations prevent and recover from cyberattacks. There are five functions or best practices associated with NIST:
- Identify
- Protect
- Detect
- Respond
- Recover
## The Center for Internet Security Critical Security Controls (CIS):
If you want your company to start small and gradually work its way up, you must go with CIS. This framework was developed in the late 2000s to protect companies from cyber threats. It’s made up of 20 controls regularly updated by security professionals from many fields (academia, government, industrial). The framework begins with basics, moves on to foundational, then finishes with organizational.
CIS uses benchmarks based on common standards like HIPAA or NIST that map security standards and offer alternative configurations for organizations not subject to mandatory security protocols but want to improve cyber security anyway.
## The International Standards Organization (ISO) frameworks ISO/IEC 27001 and 27002:
This framework is also called ISO 270K. It is considered the internationally recognized cyber security validation standard for both internal situations and across third parties. ISO 270K operates under the assumption that the organization has an Information Security Management System. ISO/IEC 27001 requires management to exhaustively manage their organization’s information security risks, focusing on threats and vulnerabilities.
## The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act:
Better known as HIPAA, it provides a framework for managing confidential patient and consumer data, particularly privacy issues. This legislation protects electronic healthcare information and is essential for healthcare providers, insurers, and clearinghouses.
# COMPONENTS OF THE FRAMEWORK:
The Cybersecurity Framework consists of three main components: the Core, Implementation Tiers, and Profiles.
## FRAMEWORK CORE:
The Framework Core provides a set of desired cybersecurity activities and outcomes using common language that is easy to understand. The Core guides organizations in managing and reducing their cybersecurity risks in a way that complements an organization’s existing cybersecurity and risk management processes. 
## FRAMEWORK IMPLEMENTATION TIERS:
The Framework Implementation Tiers assist organizations by providing context on how an organization views cybersecurity risk management. The Tiers guide organizations to consider the appropriate level of rigor for their cybersecurity program and are often used as a communication tool to discuss risk appetite, mission priority, and budget.
## FRAMEWORK PROFILE:
Framework Profiles are an organization’s unique alignment of their organizational requirements and objectives, risk appetite, and resources against the desired outcomes of the Framework Core.  Profiles are primarily used to identify and prioritize opportunities for improving cybersecurity at an organization.
# STEPS TO IMPLEMENT A FRAMEWORK:
- Establishing a set of goals
- Profile creation 
- Assessing your current position
- Conduct a gap analysis
- Create a plan of action
- Implementation
